### Improve the code in `bank_account.py`

Before fixing the code, run both pylint and flake8 so you can see how their output compares.

1. Run Pylint and iterative improve the code until Pylint gives you a score of close to 10 (may not be exactly 10).
   - it is faster if you can do this in an IDE
2. Run flake8 and improve the code until flake8 issues no warnings. A warning about too many parameters can be ignored.

Note: On Github, the default Python Application Workflow (Action) includes flake8.  This shows how populare flake8 is.

### Type Hints

Add type hints to bank account.


### Unit Tests

Create a `test_bank_account.py` containing a unittest.TestCase class to test the bank account.  What to test will be given in class.
