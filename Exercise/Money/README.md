## Money

Implement methods of the Money class in `money.py` as described in the 
assignment sheet (online).

`test_money.py` contains unit tests for the code you will write.

Run the tests using any of these:

* run tests in your IDE (usually the best choice). Pycharm: right-click on project name & choose "Run pytest".
* Command line: `python3 test_money.py`
* Command line: `python3 -m unittest test_money.py`

Good Development Style: run tests each time you implement a method.
Simply ignore failing tests for methods you have not written yet.

Poor Development Style: write all the code first, then run the tests.

## What to Submit

Push your money.py to Github.
