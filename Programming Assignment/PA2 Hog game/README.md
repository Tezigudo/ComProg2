## Game of Hog

Use the starter code in this repository in implement the Game of Hog described on <https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs61a/sp21/proj/hog/>.

## What to Submit

Write all your code in the file `hog.py`.  When you use the "ok" system to generate and run tests, "ok" will updates tests in `tests/` and updates `.ok_history`.  You should commit all these files to git and push to Github.

## Run "ok" Locally

You should always run tests locally.  Use

```bash
python3 ok --local
```

or, if you are generating test answers for question 01,
then *append* --local to the options shown on the cs61a hog assignment:

```bash
python3 ok -q 01 -u --local
```

**Do not** use `ok --submit` or `ok --score`. These commands are for CS61A students at UC Berkeley, and will fail.
