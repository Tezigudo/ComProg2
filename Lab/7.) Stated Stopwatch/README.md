## Stopwatch using States and a Graphical UI

1. Copy your Stopwatch code from Lab 1.

2. Modify the code to use states.

3. Write a graphical UI using Tkinter. In the UI please use:
   - grid layout for components
   - use **bind** to bind buttons to events
   - use a **Control Variable** for the component that shows stopwatch time
